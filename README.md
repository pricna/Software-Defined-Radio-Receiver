# Software-Defined-Radio-Receiver
Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver created in partial fulfillments of ENGR 357 "Engineering Electronics II" at Walla Walla University.

**Introduction:** This SDR receiver was designed to be simple and low cost, operate in the 10 MHz to 16 MHz frequency range, and also meet specific design criteria specified below. We ([Nate Price](https://github.com/pricna) and [Jared Evans](https://github.com/jred-KiCAD)), designed, assembled, and tested the SDR receiver to be used with a free open source SDR software, called Quisk.

**Navigation:** 
- The Descriptions folder contains our circuit description for Miles
- The Images folder contains a variety of images of our board, PCB, and schematic
- The PCB Files folder contains some versions of our PCB, separated from the rest of the schematic files
- The Project Files folder contains our Bill of Materials and project files for v1.1
- The Schematic files folder contains pdfs of all of our schematic revisions, as well as project files for each of them

**Credits:** Much of this work builds on work described in [A Comparison of Affordable, Self-Assembled Software-Defined Radio Receivers Using Quadrature Sampling Down-Conversion](http://fweb.wallawalla.edu/~frohro/ClassHandouts/Electronics/A%20Comparison%20of%20Affordable,%20Self-Assembled%20%20Software-Defined%20Radio%20Receivers%20Using%20Quadrature%20Sampling%20Down-Conversion.pdf) by the authors [Caleb Froelich](https://github.com/froeca), [Konrad McClure](https://github.com/KonradMcClure), [Joshua Silver](https://github.com/JoshSilver8), [Jordyn Watkins](https://github.com/greenjacketgirl), and our professor, [Dr. Rob Frohne](https://github.com/frohro).

**Project Status:** Currently we are trying to figure out why we cannot communicate with the Si5351 chip, and have made many modifications in our attempts to figure out all of the problems in our board/overall design. Work at this point is still very much preliminarly and ongoing.
