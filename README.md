# Software-Defined-Radio-Receiver
Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver created in partial fulfillments of ENGR 357 "Engineering Electronics II" at Walla Walla University.

**Introduction:** This SDR receiver was designed to be simple and low cost, operate in the 10 MHz to 16 MHz frequency range, and also meet specific design criteria specified below. We ([Nate Price](https://github.com/pricna) and ([Jared Evans](https://github.com/jred-KiCAD), designed, assembled, and tested the SDR receiver to be used with a free open source SDR software, called Quisk.
